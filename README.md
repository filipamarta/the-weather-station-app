# Weather Station App

This weather station react app was built by fetching OpenWeatherMap API data: current and 7 days forecast weather, both displayed by user geolocation. The user can also add and delete different cities (by country) to get the current weather, and they should be persisted. They should get feedback for all the operations that they execute.

Tech used: React JS (with Context and Hooks), Javascript ES6, SASS, UUID, Bootstrap, OpenWeatherMap API. It was build with Netlify and you can see it live here: [Weather Station App on Netlify](https://my-weather-station.netlify.app/).

This app was built as a tech challenge for *Tamanna*.
