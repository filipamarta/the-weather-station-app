# Weather Station App

This weather station react app was built by fetching OpenWeatherMap API data: current and 7 days forecast weather, both displayed by user geolocation. User can also add or delete different cities (with respective country) to get the current weather, and they should be persisted. User should get feedback for all the operations that he executes.

Tech used: React JS (with Context and Hooks), Javascript ES6, SASS, UUID, Bootstrap, OpenWeatherMap API. It was build with Netlify and you can see it live here: [Weather Station App on Netlify](https://my-weather-station.netlify.app/).

This app was built during a tech challenge for *Tamanna*.
